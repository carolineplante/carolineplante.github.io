      <p>The Flint Michigan Water Crisis began in April 2014. To this day, there is still lead found in their water. The EPA has a series of <a href="https://www.epa.gov/flint/flint-drinking-water-faqs"> recommendations</a> so households can access safe drinking water. Eight years later, drinkable water without household filtration systems is not yet a reality for residents of Flint.
</p>
      <p>The initial crisis sparked discussions country wide of the city’s lead levels. However, years later Flint’s water is barely drinkable without a household filtration system. This water crisis has lasting effects to this day for the residents of Flint, Michigan and surrounding towns. 
</p>

      <p>Linden, Michigan resident Grant Maxheimer experienced the height of the Flint Water Crisis when he was just 12 years old. He grew up near Flint, just far enough to be on the outside looking in. Maxheimer was in public school just 15 minutes outside of Flint. Although his school was not directly affected, he had a front row seat to the crisis at a young age.
</p>

      <p> This sparked a need for change in the adolescent's eyes. Maxheimer knew he wanted to make a difference early into his childhood after watching an area so close to him struggle for a basic human need: water. Seeing an area so close to him without clean water was a pivotal moment in Maxheimer’s life.
  </p>

      <p>Maxheimer, now 19, works with the Syracuse Neighborhood and Business Development Office. His current work focuses on remediating lead paint out of homes with children under six years old who meet certain income guidelines. Although he did not come to Syracuse in search of working in the lead area, the water crisis catalyzed his goals to engage in his community for the betterment of others. He takes his work as an opportunity to shape the new community in which he is a part of.
</p>

      <p>Although just a young teen when the water crisis was at its peak, Maxheimer says he wishes he could’ve done more. His current work is a reflection of that. His youth is a large reason why he works to improve the quality of life in his current community. Maxheimer says the water crisis shaped his future aspirations.
</p>

      <p>“It didn’t affect my life in the sense that we had contaminated water but it was the turning point that I started doing more community engagement work and the first time that deep inequality was ever presented to me”
</p>

      <p>Maxheimer spends his time addressing the lead crisis in Syracuse.

      <p>This graphic displays lead levels in 2017, post water crisis. The data can be found <a href="https://guides.emich.edu/datathon/data">here </a>.</p>

      <p>The chart above shows the average amounts of lead (µg/L) found in the water at different schools. The EPA set a maximum of <a href="https://extension.psu.edu/lead-in-drinking-water#:~:text=Accounting%20for%20other%20sources%20of,water%20at%2015%20%C2%B5g%2FL.">15µg/L.</a> Three years later and five of the eight schools still lack drinkable waterSchools are a key area when looking at the crisis because it extends to people of all ages.
</p>

     <p>Teachers and other staff members cover a multitude of age groups, while the students fill in the rest of the years. The effect the water crisis has on schools affects people of all age ranges across the city. Entire schools had to turn to the reliability of bottled water to get through, and to this day some people are still using them.

    <p> The average lead levels in Flint daycares shown above are all at safe levels. The children of Flint have access to cleaner water than they did before. The youth to come will have access to filtered water. This shows a promising future for the youth of Flint.</p>

    <p>Lead levels continue to go down year after year by small increments. However, the damage that was done from the initial crisis is irreversible. The children growing up in Flint now who are going to daycare will have safer levels of water to drink. However, those children who came before them cannot get the years of dirty water back.</p>

 
      <p>Although filtration systems are getting better, the crisis is still ongoing. The filtration systems are working better, but the water itself is still contaminated. Although officials have deemed water lean enough to drink, they still shy against it if there is another option (Strauss, 2019).
